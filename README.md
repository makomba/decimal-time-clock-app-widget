A clock with decimal time for mobile devices App Widget

Display a clock with two times with a widget on the home screen in mobile devices.

Decimal time clock: 100 hours per day, 100 minutes per hour, 100 seconds per minute.

Display:
First time in digits: clock with the device time (HH:MM:SS)
Second time in digits: clock with the calculated decimal time (HH:MM:SS)

Calculating:
- get the timestamp (UTC) from the device.
- calculate the decimal time with the timestamp. (formular available).

Help needed. I can not program apps widgets.
